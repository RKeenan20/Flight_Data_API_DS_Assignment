    "For the first API, I have chosen to use the Aviationstack API which is one of the largest and most utilised APIs for real time and historical flight data. I will use this in unison with a weather API which will be used to determine the correlation/relationship between the weather and flight's statuses at different airports. I will then further investigate whether the weather affects different airlines, routes or airplane models differently such as between a small regional jet and a large, long range jet such as the Boeing 777.\n",
    "- The Aviationstack API can be found here: https://aviationstack.com\n",
    "- The weather API can be found here at: TODO/FIXME\n",
    "\n",
    "I will firstly import any libraries or packages needed and then make a start on the data collection stage of the assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each API has thorough documentation on their websites detailing all of the endpoints available to a user, how to make an API request and how to tailor these requests for the information you need for your purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API 1: Aviationstack API \n",
    "I received an API key for my Aviationstack account which is given as b4a871dbf85b4f670dafbdc9615a68e9.\n",
    "In terms of the Aviationstack API, a number of pieces of information can be gathered such as real-time or historical data, different routes, airports, planes, aircraft types and countries. All of these endpoints or pieces of information can be used to infer something from the data.\n",
    "The Aviationstack API allows 500 free API requests a month and I chose this one over FlightAware as FlightAware charges for each request.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the aviationstack API, each API call returns 100 flights using the \"flights\" endpoint which is determined by the \"limit\" of 100. Unfortunately the limit is 100 for the free and basic paid plans. I have the Free plan which allows you the 500 API calls a month, but I emailed the Customer Support team who were happy to give me a free upgrade to the Basic Plan for 2 weeks to complete the project which allows 10,000 calls a month as well as access to Historical flight data which would make my analysis a little easier. If I wanted to gather 300 items from the same endpoint, I would need to use the \"offset\" variable to move the starting point by 100 each time. This would mean I had 3 files.\n",
    "\n",
    "These 3 JSON files will need to be cleaned and combined with each other to create one file. \n",

In this case, the real time flights endpoint will provide with all of the flights in a day. I used the parameters of \"flight_status\": \"landed\", \"dep_iata\": \"DUB\" and obviously, I needed \"offset\" to iterate through the results as I am limited to 100 results per API call. DUB is the IATA code of Dublin Airport. I could have used the ICAO code of EIDW either. In this case, I have obtained over 800 flights for departures which will need to be combined together before I can use the for analysis. "

    "### Step 1: Loading and cleaning API data\n",
    "In terms of the aviationstack API data which is now stored in JSON file format. I will need to load it, normalize it into an appropriate data structure so that I can analyse the data. Each flight or item in an API request has a number of fields such as \"departure\", \"arrival\", \"airline\", \"aircraft\" and many more. Inside each of these fields is a lot more information such as IATA/ICAO codes, airport information and aircraft registrations. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the majority of this information is available to me in an API request but sometimes some of this information is returned as \"null\" such as the aircraft model type and its registration which is more than likely the most common. One of the fields, \"live\", is relegated for information about a live flight still in the air but I have preferred to use flights that have a status of \"landed\". As a result, it is up to me to load the data and clean it appropriately so that I can interpret the data properly without the effect of these redundant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other case that I need to consider is that codeshares between airlines can make the data awkward to deal with. In the case of a flight from Dublin to London Heathrow, the airline reported by the API request could be Qatar Airways which is a member of OneWorld Alliance with British Airways who actually operated the flight. As a result, I need to delete these codeshared flights if the original flight is also present in the API request. "
