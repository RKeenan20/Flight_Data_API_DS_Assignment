    "For the first API, I have chosen to use the Aviationstack API which is one of the largest and most utilised APIs for real time and historical flight data. I will use this in unison with a weather API which will be used to determine the correlation/relationship between the weather and flight's statuses at different airports. I will then further investigate whether the weather affects different airlines, routes or airplane models differently such as between a small regional jet and a large, long range jet such as the Boeing 777.\n",
